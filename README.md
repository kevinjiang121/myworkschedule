# myworkschedule
A simple webapp that employees can use to check-in check-out along with some additional functionalities such as checking shifts and viewing upcoming events.

The front-end being built on jsp, html, jsps, and javascript.

The back-end is being handled through java servlets.

The database program used is MySQL and maintained both manually via SQL scripts as well as through PHP MyAdmin. The WebApp itself is being hosted through Apache Tomcat.

I used IntelliJ to help me maintain and run the web app.
